I have used Q-Learning, a Reinforcement Learning technique to show that a AI agent can play a game like Ludo with a good level of Accuracy.

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for a given finite Markov decision process (MDP). It does so by learning the value of the state-action pairs, which helps an agent to maximize the cumulative reward over time. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Q-learning works:

Initialize Q-Table:

Create a Q-table with dimensions corresponding to the number of states and the number of possible actions in those states.
Initialize all the Q-values to zero (or small random values).
Choose an Action (Exploration vs. Exploitation):

At each state 
𝑠
s, choose an action 
𝑎
a based on an exploration-exploitation strategy. Common strategies include:
ε-greedy: With probability 
𝜖
ϵ, choose a random action (exploration), and with probability 
1
−
𝜖
1−ϵ, choose the action with the highest Q-value for the current state (exploitation).
Softmax: Choose actions probabilistically based on their Q-values, giving higher probability to actions with higher Q-values.
Perform the Action and Observe the Outcome:

Execute the chosen action 
𝑎
a and observe the resulting state 
𝑠
′
s 
′
  and the reward 
𝑟
r received.
Update Q-Value:

Update the Q-value for the state-action pair 
(
𝑠
,
𝑎
)
(s,a) using the Q-learning update rule:

 Q(s

Here:
𝛼
α is the learning rate (0 < 
𝛼
α ≤ 1), determining how much the new information overrides the old.
𝛾
γ is the discount factor (0 ≤ 
𝛾
γ < 1), determining the importance of future rewards.

 Q(s

 ) represents the maximum Q-value for the next state 
𝑠
′
s 
′
  over all possible actions 
𝑎

a

 .
Repeat:

Repeat the process for a number of episodes or until the Q-values converge (i.e., they stop changing significantly).
Key Concepts
Learning Rate (
𝛼
α): Controls how quickly the algorithm updates Q-values. A high learning rate may lead to faster learning but can also cause instability.
Discount Factor (
𝛾
γ): Balances the importance of immediate versus future rewards. A high discount factor makes future rewards more significant.
Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balances between exploring new actions to discover their rewards and exploiting known actions that yield high rewards.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:

Simple to understand and implement.
Effective for many types of problems, including those where the environment is unknown and changes over time.
Disadvantages:

Can be slow to converge, especially with large state and action spaces.
Requires careful tuning of parameters like 
𝛼
α and 
𝛾
γ.
Exploration-exploitation trade-off can be challenging to balance.
Q-learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning and serves as a basis for more advanced methods, such as Deep Q-Learning, where neural networks are used to approximate the Q-values.
